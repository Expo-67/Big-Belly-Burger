The term “API” stands for Application Programming Interface. If you break that down word by word, you can get a pretty good grasp of what it means.

An API is an interface that can be used to develop software that interacts with an existing application.

In practice, an API is “a set of functions and procedures” that allows you to access and build upon the data and functionality of an existing application.

# Example

To describe the concept in further detail, we need to comprehend the basics. Let’s start with the analogy of a restaurant menu. When we go to a restaurant to eat, we choose from what is provided in the menu. At this point, we convey our choices to the waiter. He/she then takes our order to the chef who prepares our meal and our food arrives so we can enjoy a nice meal. At this stage, it's only natural to ask ourselves: do we know what the chef used to cook our fish or steak? How was it prepared? This back-and-forth analogy serves as a starting point for our explanation.

Why? Because with an API, we really don’t know what’s going on behind the scenes at the restaurant. All we really know is that we gave our order, it was processed and out comes our dinner on a nice plate.

A web service is a resource that is made available on the internet. Therefore, web services, by definition, require a **network**.

The term “web service” is defined by W3C (the World Wide Web Consortium), so it technically follows a whole host of standards.  
To test web services, developers often use Postman

To install Postman visit [https://www.postman.com/](https://www.postman.com/)

# API and Web Services

An API defines the methods and instructions for one software program to interact with another. When this action involves sending data over a network, Web services come into the picture.  
An API generally involves calling functions from within a software program.

### Requests

We can imagine the web browser as the client and the computer application that hosts a web site as the server.

**Example:** A client (browser) submits a HTTP request to the server then the server returns a response to the client.  
The response contains status information about the request and may also contain the requested content.

# Methods

The most-commonly-used HTTP verbs (or methods, as they are properly called) are **POST**, **GET**, **PUT**, **PATCH**, and **DELETE**. These correspond to create, read, update, and delete (or CRUD) operations. There are a number of other verbs too, but they are used less frequently. One of those methods are OPTIONS and HEAD. These are used more often than others.

# Status

HTTP response status codes indicate whether a specific HTTP request has been successfully completed or not. Responses are grouped in five classes

1. Informational responses (100–199),
    
2. Successful responses (200–299),
    
3. Redirects (300–399),
    
4. Client errors (400–499),
    
5. Server errors (500–599).
    

### ***What is the purpose of HTTP status codes***

HTTP status codes are standard response codes given by web site servers on the internet. The codes help identify the cause of the problem when a web page or other resource does not load properly.

# What is a base URL?

![](https://i.imgur.com/zPWdLzT.png align="left")

A base URL is basically the consistent part of your web address.

For example, you'll note that the address section [https://www.google.com/](https://www.google.com/) always appears in the address bar.

This is the base URL. Everything that follows it is known as a URL path.

To find the base URL of your website, go to the site's front page. What you see in the address bar on your site's front page is the base URL of your website.

## The base URL example

The following is an example of a well-formed REST URL:

https://284-RPR-133.mktorest.com/rest/v1/lead/318581.json?fields=email,firstName,lastName

Which is composed of the following parts:

**Base URL:** [https://284-RPR-133.mktorest.com/rest](https://)

**Path:** /v1/lead/

**Resource:** 318581.json

**Query parameter:** fields=email,firstName,lastName

# What’s fetch?

To fetch data from an API, we can use the JavaScript fetch method. We can also use an external library like axios, request, superagent, supertest and many others.  
In this Super Skill, we are going to use the fetch method.

The fetch method is provided by web APIs and it’s supported by almost all the new browser versions.

PS. There is no need to install anything.

# The GET request with React.

Well let’s explain some concepts first. When we send a request to an API, it will take some time to find the needed data from its resources and return exactly what we want. Therefore, JavaScript will not block the rest of the operation but it will continue executing the rest of the program and when the API gives us a result of our request, JavaScript will handle it then. This is the asynchronous approach in JavaScript, we will see it in more detail in other super skills.  
For the time being, JavaScript gives us the `.then()` `.catch()` methods to deal with asynchronous functions.  
In simpler terms, when calling an API, we tell the browser that the response will take some time so it can go continuing its work and it will notify us when the response gets back.

  

```javascript
function fetchData() {// the function to fetch data from the api

     fetch("https://hn.algolia.com/api/v1/search?query=redux")

       .then(res => res.json())// when the result comes back with success here is what to do

       .then(res => setData(res))

       .catch(err => setError(err));// if there is an error here what you have to do.

   }
```

# What’s JSON?

JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is the most widely used data format for data interchange on the web. This data interchange can happen between two computer applications at different geographical locations or running within the same machine.

The good thing is that JSON is a format that's understandable by both humans and machines. So while applications/libraries can parse the JSON data – humans can also look at data and derive meaning from it.  
A JSON document may contain text, curly braces, square brackets, colons, commas, double quotes, and maybe a few other characters.

Primarily, JSON is built on two structures:

1. A collection of name/value pairs. In various languages, this is realized as an object, record, structure, dictionary, hash table, keyed list, or an associative array.
    
2. An ordered list of values. In most languages, this is realized as an array, vector, list, or sequence.

# POST with React.

The fetch API also gives us the ability to post data to the API.

```javascript
function postData() {

     // the function to post data to the api

     fetch("https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users", {

       method: "POST", //setting the method

       headers: {
         Accept: "application/json",
         "Content-Type": "application/json"
       },//setting the header
       body: JSON.stringify(user)//setting the body
     })
       .then(res => res.json())

       .then(res => setData(res))

       .catch(err => setError(err));
   }
```

In the example above we gonna add user in the Api `"`[`https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users`](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users)`"`, we gonna use Post Method

# POST with React.

In this code below, we have added an input for the name. If we click add, it will add a user inside the API.

```javascript
const App = () => {

 const [user, setUser] = useState();

 const handleSubmit = e => {

   e.preventDefault();

   fetch("https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users", {

     method: "POST",

     headers: {

       Accept: "application/json",

       "Content-Type": "application/json"

     },

     body: JSON.stringify(user)

   })

     .then(res => res.json())

     .then(res => console.log(res))

     .catch(err => console.log(err));

 };



 const handleChange = e =>

   setUser({ id: Date.now(), [e.target.name]: e.target.value });
return (

   <div>

     <form onSubmit={handleSubmit}>

       <label>

         Person Name:

         <input type="text" name="name" onChange={handleChange} />

       </label>

       <button type="submit">Add</button>

     </form>

   </div>

 );

};

export default App;
```

# What’s Axios?

Axios is a promise based HTTP client for the browser and Node.js.  
By using Axios it’s easy to send asynchronous HTTP request to REST endpoints and perform CRUD operations. The Axios library can be used in your plain JavaScript application or can be used together with more advanced frameworks like React.js  
There are some difference between axios the fetch web API:  
Syntax: the http request using axios is more simple than using fetch  
Support: the fetch web API is not supported by all the browser, on the other hand axios is supported even by the old browser version (like IE)  
Response timeout: the timeout set up is much easier using axois than using the fetch API.

### What Axios Is:

* **Promise-based**: Axios uses promises, which means it provides asynchronous handling of HTTP requests and responses. This makes it compatible with modern JavaScript features like `async/await`.
    
* **HTTP Client**: It supports common HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.) to interact with APIs, send data, retrieve information, and more.
    

### Install Axios

To install axios we simply run the following command:

```javascript
npm i axios

// or

npm install axios
```

# Use Axios

Axios syntax is mostly like the fetch API.  
To Perform a get request:

```javascript
// Make a request for a user with a given ID

axios.get('/user?ID=12345')

 .then(function (response) {

   // handle success

   console.log(response);

 })

 .catch(function (error) {

   // handle error

   console.log(error);

 })
```

# Posting Data using Axios

The post request syntax is the following:  
[`axios.post`](http://axios.post)`(url, data,config)`

* Url: the url of the api
    
* Data: the data to be sent (optional field)
    
* Config: the header configuration (optional field)  
    

```javascript
axios

 .post("/user", {

   firstName: "Fred",

   lastName: "Flintstone"

 })

 .then(function(response) {

   console.log(response);

 })

 .catch(function(error) {

   console.log(error);

 });
```

# Chaining request

Axios comes with build in feature which gives us the ability to send multiple requests.  

```javascript
const requestOne = axios.get("https://api.storyblok.com/v1/cdn/stories/health?version=published&token=wANpEQEsMYGOwLxwXQ76Ggtt");

const requestTwo = axios.get(https://api.storyblok.com/v1/cdn/datasources/?token=wANpEQEsMYGOwLxwXQ76Ggtt");

const requestThree = axios.get("https://api.storyblok.com/v1/cdn/stories/vue?version=published&token=wANpEQEsMYGOwLxwXQ76Ggtt");




axios

 .all([requestOne, requestTwo, requestThree])

 .then(axios.spread((firstResponse, secondResponse, thirdResponse) => {

     console.log(firstResponse.data,secondResponse.data, thirdResponse.data);

   })

 )
.catch(errors => {

   console.error(errors);

 });
```

# Headers:

**HTTP header** fields are components of the header section of request and response messages in the HTTP Protocol. They define the operating parameters of an HTTP transaction.

```javascript
//example of headers using postman

{

 'content-type': 'application/x-www-form-urlencoded',

 'user-agent': 'PostmanRuntime/7.22.0',

 accept: '*/*',

 'cache-control': 'no-cache',

 'postman-token': '35f27261-d4da-47d7-b540-9216d4fa694e',

 host: '127.0.0.1:3001',

 'accept-encoding': 'gzip, deflate, br',

 'content-length': '37',

 connection: 'keep-alive
}
```

# Headers:

The REST headers and parameters contain a wealth of information that can help you track down issues when you encounter them. HTTP Headers are an important part of the API request and response as they represent the meta-data associated with the API request and response. Headers carry information for:

1. Request and Response Body
    
2. Request Authorization
    
3. Response Caching
    
4. Response Cookies
    

Other than the above categories HTTP headers also carry a lot of other information around HTTP connection types, proxies etc. Most of these headers are for management of connections between client, server and proxies and do not require explicit validation through testing

Headers are mostly classified as request headers and response headers, know the major request and response headers. You will have to set the request headers when you are sending the request for testing an API and you will have to set the assertion against the response headers to ensure that right headers are being returned

The headers that you will encounter the most during API testing are the following, you may need to set values for these or set assertions against these headers to ensure that they convey the right information and everything works fine in the API:

**Authorization:** Carries credentials containing the authentication information of the client for the resource being requested.

**WWW-Authenticate:** This is sent by the server if it needs a form of authentication before it can respond with the actual resource being requested. Often sent along with a response code of 401, which means ‘unauthorized’.

**Accept-Charset:** This is a header which is set with the request and tells the server about which character sets are acceptable by the client.

**Content-Type:** Indicates the media type (text/html or text/JSON) of the response sent to the client by the server, this will help the client in processing the response body correctly.

**Cache-Control:** This is the cache policy defined by the server for this response, a cached response can be stored by the client and re-used till the time defined by the Cache-Control header.
