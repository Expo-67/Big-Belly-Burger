This is a high level programing language that is used to <mark>add interactivity and dynamic behavior on a website</mark>.( making web pages interactive)

### Key Features of JavaScript:

1. **Client-Side Scripting**: Runs in <mark>web browsers to create interactive user interfaces without requiring server interaction</mark>.
    
2. **Event-Driven**: Responds to user actions like clicks, form submissions, or keypresses.
    
3. **Dynamic Typing**: Variables can hold different types of data without specifying their type.
    
4. **First-Class Functions**: Functions are treated as first-class objects, enabling their use as arguments, return values, or assigned to variables.
    
5. **Prototype-Based Object Orientation**: Supports object-oriented programming through prototypal inheritance.
    
6. **Cross-Platform**: Works across different devices and operating systems as long as a browser or JavaScript runtime is available.
    
7. **Server-side JavaScript-** allows an application to communicate with a database
    

**JavaScript and the ECMAScript specification-**

European Computer Manufacturers Association- delivers standardized international programming language based on JavaScript.

# Alert, Prompt & Confirm

There are several methods to make JavaScript output and/or grab data (from the user). They either **modify** or **replace** existing HTML, help **debug**, or **retrieve** HTML content. Letâ€™s take a look at some of the methods:

* **alert()** A simple function to display a message to a dialog box (also called alert box).The alert() method cannot interact with the visitor.
    

```javascript
alert("This is an alert box");
```

* **prompt()** To interact with the user we use prompt() which asks the visitor to input information and stores the information in a variable.
    
    ```javascript
    var visitorName = prompt("What's your name : ")
    ```

* **confirm()** This method displays a dialog box with two buttons (OK and Cancel) and text as a parameter. If the user clicks on the OK button, confirm() returns true and on clicking the Cancel button, confirm() returns false.
    
    ```javascript
    var isCoolWithIt = confirm("Are you ok with it?")
    ```

In JavaScript instructions are called *statements* and are separated by semicolons:

**Comments**

```javascript
/ a one line comment

/* this is a longer,
 * multi-line comment
 */
```

**code wars: practice 1**

Create a function that takes an integer as an argument and returns `"Even"` for even numbers or `"Odd"` for odd numbers.

```javascript
function OddorEven (n){
  if (n%2 === 0){
    return "Even"
  } else {
   return "Odd"
  }
}
let n=2
console.log(OddorEven(2))
```
