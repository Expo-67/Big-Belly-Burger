Start by installing the dependencies first in the package.json file,(`npm init -y`), install mongoose, dotenv, express.

Be sure to have install nodejs installed.

If you are using es6 be sure to set the <mark>type to module</mark> in the package.json, be sure to also set main to server.js in the package.json file

Put the .env file where your backend folder is located

Create a .env file where you store your enviriomental variables for **Security**: It keeps sensitive data (like database credentials, API keys) out of your source code, reducing the risk of accidental exposure.

Be sure that when you do decide to have a database in a different folder from the server.js be sure to export the database file(

```javascript
export { connectDatabase };
```

be sure to import connect database in the server.js

Inside the .env we have the connection string to the database and just after net we insert the name of the database in this case its persorns <mark>net/persons</mark>

```javascript
MONGO_URI="mongodb+srv://kinungijames129:<password here>@cluster0.befj3.mongodb.net/persons?retryWrites=true&w=majority&appName=Cluster0"
```

In the server.js file which is the main file in the backend start by importing express, mongoose and dotenv. Load the enviromental variables (`dotenv.config()`), create an instance of express application, establish a connection to the database.

Establishing connection to database:

```javascript
mongoose
  .connect(process.env.MONGO_URI)
  .then(() => console.log("Connected to MongoDB"))
  .catch((err) => console.error("Could not connect to MongoDB", err));
```

You can define a simple route where we can display some output ,in the example we can see the path and the parameters request and response passed we pass a response to send Welcome to the Api

```javascript
app.get("/", (req, res) => {
  res.send("Welcome to the API!"); // Response for the home route
});
```

The output is displayed in the server port 3001

```javascript
app.listen(3001, () => {
  console.log("Server is running on port 3001");
});
```

Create a schema: a schema defines the <mark>structure of data</mark> including what fields of data exist, the type of data ensuiring data consistency, after creating a schema be sure to create a model for the schema the model is for **Data Interaction**: Models provide an interface to interact with the database. They define how to create, read, update, and delete (CRUD) records, making it easier to handle database operations. Next make sure you Save the document

Make sure you import the schema file in the server.js then the database in MongoDB will be visible and the collection.

To insert multiple records to your database see the example below

```javascript

// Person schema
const PersonSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
  name: {
    type: String,
    required: true, //Validator
  },
  age: {
    type: Number,
    required: true, //Validator
    min: 0, // age should be a positive number
  },
  favoriteFoods: {
    type: [String],
    default: [], // an empty array
  },
  email: {
    type: String,
    unique: true, // email put as unique
  },
});
// Create a model from the schema
const Person = mongoose.model("Person", PersonSchema);
const arrayOfPeople = [
  {
    name: "John",
    age: 30,
    favoriteFoods: ["Pizza", "Burger"],
    email: "john@example.com",
  },
  {
    name: "Jane",
    age: 28,
    favoriteFoods: ["Salad", "Sushi"],
    email: "jane@example.com",
  },
  {
    name: "Alice",
    age: 25,
    favoriteFoods: ["Pasta", "Ice Cream"],
    email: "alice@example.com",
  },
  {
    name: "Bob",
    age: 35,
    favoriteFoods: ["Steak", "Fries"],
    email: "bob@example.com",
  },
];
// insert multiple records
const createManyPeople = async (people) => {
  try {
    const savedPeople = await Person.create(people);
    console.log("People added to the database:", savedPeople);
  } catch (err) {
    console.error("Error adding people:", err);
  }
};
// call the function
createManyPeople(arrayOfPeople);
```

### FIND

We can use find method to search for data in our database we just need to establish the route pass in the req and res, create a variable called names that stores the names of the request parameters, next introduce the try and catch use try to create a variable called People that stores the find for matching records and the catch to console log any errors that we do encouter.

```javascript
app.get("/people/:name", async (req, res) => {
  const name = req.params.name; // get the name from the request parameters
  try {
    const people = await Person.find({ name: name }); // find matching records
    res.json(people); // send records in json format
  } catch (err) {
    console.error("Error finding people", err); // handles the error
    res.status(500).send("Internal Server Error"); // error response
  }
});
```

Use Postman to check out the output if you dont have it make sure to install it in the extensions click on new http request and specify GET pass in the URL of the route [http://localhost:3001/people/John](http://localhost:3001/people/John) it will print out Johns details
